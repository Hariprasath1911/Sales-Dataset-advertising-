#1 Code:
top_store = df_ads.loc[df_ads['sales'].idxmax()]  #getting the max value from sales column
top_store                                         # printing the max sales store details

#2:
Null_data=df_ads.isnull().sum()                   # calculating how many null data in entire data

#3:
df_ads.describe()                                 # This command gives the Mean, Standard deviation and some basic calculation for entire table

#4:
df_ads["total_spent"]=df_ads["TV"]+df_ads["newspaper"]+df_ads["sales"]        # Adding one more column in the data set to calculate the total spending of each store
df_ads.nlargest(5,"total_spent")                                              # Filtering the top 5 store on the total_spent
